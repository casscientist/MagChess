# MagChess
This is a personal project:
- Chess interface for playing Chess similar to online
- Designed to work with custom-board that tracks pieces and uploads moves into software to be analyzed
- This means an over-the-board game of chess could be played with times, saved as a pgn file, and analyzed through Lichess
- Currently only utilizes manual move selection as board is not complete
- See Bugs/Intended Features for plans
